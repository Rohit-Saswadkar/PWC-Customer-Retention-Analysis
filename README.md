## Project Description:
A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
The Retentions Manager has provided some information in the resources.

## Approach - 

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation:

- Gather customer churn data from the database.
- Cleanse the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting inconsistencies.
- Perform data transformations such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating to prepare the data for analysis.

## 2. Define Key Metrics and KPIs:

- Identify the key metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with the business objectives and stakeholder requirements.
- Metrics can include # of customers at risk, # of tech tickets, % of churn rate, % of churned senior citizens etc.

## 3. Data Modeling:
- Create calculated columns and measures to derive additional insights from the data, such as Loyalty and Risk Category on the basis of tenure.

## 4. Visualization Design:

- Design visually appealing and insightful dashboards and reports using Power BI's wide range of visualization options.
- Utilize charts, graphs, maps, and tables to present key insights effectively.
- Ensure consistency in design elements such as color schemes, fonts, and layout across all visuals to enhance readability and user experience.

## 5. Segmentation and Filtering:

- Implement interactive features like slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities to allow users to segment data based on different criteria such as Internet service, Risk of Churn, Months Subscribed and Contact type.
- Enable users to explore data dynamically and gain deeper insights by interacting with the report visuals.

## 6. Insights and Analysis:

- Provide meaningful analysis and insights derived from the data, highlighting trends, patterns.
- Use descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and comparative analysis to uncover valuable insights that support decision-making and strategy development.

## 7. Narrative and Commentary:

- Incorporate narrative elements and commentary to provide context and interpretation for the data visualizations.
- Explain the significance of key findings, trends, and variations observed in the data to facilitate understanding for stakeholders.

## 8. Iteration and Refinement:

Continuously iterate and refine the report based on feedback from stakeholders and users.

Incorporate any additional requirements or modifications to enhance the report's effectiveness and relevance.
